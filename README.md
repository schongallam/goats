# My Git Learning
## my notes:
- vscode good
- jetbrains better but expensive (kinda)
- sublime merge good



## Git is not just a website
it is a version control system...
... AND...
it can exist independently on my own machine!
- we branched
- we made some commits on the branch
- we merged
    - we reconciled the conflicts
    - we committed the resolutions
- we celebrated

## working with others
Never force push!
- unless you hate them

'origin' is the typical name for the remote on github

'fetch' will retrieve a list of the changes that were made, without downloading the changes themseles

use the up and down arrows in the upper-right corner of sublime merge


## here is the product:
